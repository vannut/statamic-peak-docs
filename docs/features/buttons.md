# Buttons

The files `resources/fieldsets/buttons.yaml` and `resources/views/components/_buttons.antlers.html` go together. The button fieldset is a set in Bard but can also be called from other fieldsets where you want to include buttons. Just call the buttons partial in your template and one or multiple buttons will be rendered.
