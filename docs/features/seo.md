# SEO

Peak includes full SEO support. It's easy to expand on since it's all built with native fields and templating. You can also easily replace it with a professional addon like [Aardvark SEO](https://statamic.com/addons/candour/aardvark-seo) or [SEO Pro](https://statamic.com/addons/statamic/seo-pro). 

## SEO features
